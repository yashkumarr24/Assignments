Real-World Applications of C Programming  

1. Embedded Systems – Used in automotive systems, medical devices, and consumer electronics due to its efficiency and direct hardware interaction.  

2. Operating Systems – Most OS kernels (Linux, Windows, macOS) are written in C for performance, portability, and low-level system access.  

3. Game Development – Popular game engines use C for performance-critical components, enabling fast computations and efficient memory management.
